# Insticator FE Code Challenge - Multi-Select Dropdown

Thanks for working on this coding challenge.<br /> 
We appreciate you taking the time to showcase your skills.

Please download the React app from this GIT repo.<br />
We've setup a basic framework for you to work within.<br />
Please follow the instructions below and send a GITHUB link or a zip of your project files when completed.

*Estimated Time: 4h*


## Assets

[Dropdown Design in Abstract](https://share.goabstract.com/81867b88-8702-4cf1-af95-956b2fc66234)

## Expected Architecture

- Create a JSON data file that represents the websites listed in the dropdown
- Fetch this data and store it in application state

## Expected UI

- End result should match the given design
- User should be able to scroll vertically the list of dropdown items<br />(if you need to make the box shorter or add more data to showcase this, please do)

## Expected Functionality

- When an item is selected, we should add/remove item from the reducer.
- When filter button is clicked, we should log all the items that we have stored in redux.
- "All Sites" label should change to read how many sites have been selected. (ex: 3 sites selected)

## Nice to haves *(not required)*

- User should be able to filter via search within the dropdown items.
- User should be able to select all checkboxes.
- User should be able to deselect all checkboxes.

## Tips

- Please use [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free) for the iconography
- Code Quality, UI, and UX count heavily!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
