__________ Expected Architecture __________
	- This is a React/Redux app
	- Create a JSON data file that represents the websites listed in the dropdown
	- Fetch this data and store it in app state


__________ Expected UI __________
	- End result should match the given design
	- User should be able to scroll vertically the list of dropdown items (if you need to make the box shorter or add more data to showcase this, please do)


__________ Expected Functionality __________
	- When an item is selected, we should add/remove item from the reducer.
	- When filter button is clicked, we should log all the items that we have stored in redux.
	- "All Sites" label should change to read how many sites have been selected. (ex: 3 sites selected)


__________ Nice to haves (not required) __________
    - User should be able to filter via search within the dropdown items.
    - User should be able to select all checkboxes.
    - User should be able to deselect all checkboxes.


__________ Tips __________
	- Please use fontawesome (https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free) for the iconography
	- Code Quality, UI, and UX count heavily!
